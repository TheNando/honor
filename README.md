# Honor Community Market

Honor is a community market site designed to allow small communities of users
who know and trust each other to sell and trade items with each other.

Similar to auction sites such as Ebay, with Honor, users may do the following:

- List items for sell or trade, setting the following info
  - Title
  - Images
  - Description
  - Price or accepted offer details
- Browse or search available items
- Send inquires about items to listers
- Make offers for available listings

However, unlike traditional market sites, Honor does not have any functionality
to manage transactions. Users make those arrangements on their own. On one hand,
this makes community trust a requirement, but it removes the need for a 3rd part
merchant service to be involved in any transaction. And it empowers users to use
whatever transaction system they desire.

## Why does Honor not handle transactions?

This project is intended for small, tight-knit communities (ie. work-places,
families, churches) to be able to easily sell and trade their items without all
the overhead of an typical marketing site. Solving for a merchant solution adds
lots of complexity to the application and removes the freedom of users to set
their own terms. With this flexibility, you can accepts cash, trades, or any 3rd
party service you like.

## Tech Stack

Honor is built with the [Deno](https://deno.land/) runtime and the
[Aleph](https://alephjs.org/) web framework.
